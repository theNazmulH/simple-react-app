Requirements:


 


Create a new React application using Create React App or any other preferred method.


The application should consist of a single page with a header, a content section, and a footer.


The header should display the title of your application.


The content section should contain a button and a text area.


When the button is clicked, the text in the text area should be displayed below the button.


The footer should display some information about yourself or your favorite quote.


Guidelines:


 


Create a new React component called App to serve as the main component of your application.


Inside the App component, create three child components: Header, Content, and Footer.


The Header component should receive a prop for the title and display it as the heading of the page.


The Content component should contain a state variable to store the text entered in the text area. It should also have a button that triggers a function to update the state variable with the text from the text area. Finally, it should display the entered text below the button.


The Footer component should display some information about yourself or your favorite quote. Feel free to be creative here.
